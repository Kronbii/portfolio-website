# Open Graph Image Generation Prompt

## For GPT-5 / DALL-E / Midjourney / Stable Diffusion

Use this prompt to generate your Open Graph image:

---

## Main Prompt:

```
Create a professional Open Graph image (1200x630px, 16:9 aspect ratio) for a portfolio website. 

Design specifications:
- Dark background (#0a0a0a or very dark gray/black)
- Muted green accent color (#22c55e or similar - not bright or flashy, but subtle and professional)
- Modern, clean, and creative design style
- Professional tech/engineering aesthetic
- Minimalist but not too minimal - balanced design

Content to include:
- Large text: "Rami Kronbi" (prominent, white or light gray)
- Subtitle: "AI & Computer Vision Engineer"
- Website URL: "ramikronbi.vercel.app" (smaller, muted green or gray)
- Subtle tech/AI visual elements (optional): abstract geometric shapes, circuit patterns, or neural network nodes in muted green - very subtle, not overwhelming

Style:
- Modern tech portfolio aesthetic
- Dark theme with green accents
- Professional and sophisticated
- Clean typography
- Subtle gradients or patterns allowed
- No cluttered elements
- Balance between minimal and creative

Color palette:
- Primary background: #0a0a0a (very dark)
- Text: #e5e5e5 (light gray/white)
- Accent: #22c55e (muted green)
- Secondary text: #a3a3a3 (medium gray)

Layout:
- Text should be left-aligned or centered
- Generous white space
- Professional spacing between elements
- Website URL at bottom in smaller font
```

## Alternative Shorter Prompt:

```
Professional Open Graph image, 1200x630px, dark theme (#0a0a0a background), muted green accents (#22c55e), modern tech portfolio style. Text: "Rami Kronbi" large and prominent in white, subtitle "AI & Computer Vision Engineer" in light gray, website URL "ramikronbi.vercel.app" at bottom in muted green. Subtle abstract tech elements (geometric shapes, neural network patterns) in muted green, very subtle. Professional, clean, modern, balanced design - not too minimal, not too busy.
```

## For Specific AI Tools:

### DALL-E 3:
```
A professional Open Graph social media image, 1200x630 pixels, dark background color #0a0a0a, with muted green accent color #22c55e. Modern tech portfolio design. Large white text "Rami Kronbi" at top, subtitle "AI & Computer Vision Engineer" in light gray, website "ramikronbi.vercel.app" at bottom in muted green. Subtle abstract geometric tech patterns in muted green. Professional, clean, modern aesthetic.
```

### Midjourney:
```
professional Open Graph image, 1200x630, dark theme portfolio, muted green accents, modern tech design, "Rami Kronbi" text prominent white, "AI & Computer Vision Engineer | Project Manager" subtitle, website URL bottom, subtle geometric tech elements, clean minimalist professional --ar 16:9 --style modern --v 6
```

### Stable Diffusion:
```
professional Open Graph image, 1200x630px, dark background #0a0a0a, muted green #22c55e accents, modern tech portfolio, "Rami Kronbi" large white text, "AI & Computer Vision Engineer | Project Manager" subtitle gray, website URL bottom, subtle abstract tech patterns, clean professional design, high quality

## Design Tips:

1. **Text Hierarchy:**
   - Name: Largest, most prominent
   - Title: Medium size, readable
   - URL: Smallest, subtle

2. **Visual Elements:**
   - Keep tech elements very subtle (10-20% opacity)
   - Don't let visuals compete with text
   - Use muted green sparingly for accents

3. **Typography:**
   - Use modern, clean sans-serif fonts
   - Ensure text is readable at small sizes (social media thumbnails)
   - High contrast between text and background

4. **Testing:**
   - Preview at 1200x630px
   - Also check how it looks at smaller sizes (social media previews)
   - Ensure text is readable when scaled down

---

## After Generation:

1. Save the image as `og-image.jpg` or `og-image.png`
2. Place it in the `public/` folder
3. Ensure it's exactly 1200x630px (or crop/resize if needed)
4. Optimize file size (should be under 200KB for fast loading)
5. Test by sharing your website link on social media
