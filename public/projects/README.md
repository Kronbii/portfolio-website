# Project Images

## Required Images

Place your project showcase images here with these exact names:

1. **project1.jpg** - Image for your first project
2. **project2.jpg** - Image for your second project  
3. **project3.jpg** - Image for your third project

## Image Format

- ✅ **Use**: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- ❌ **Don't use**: SVG (SVG is for icons/logos, not project screenshots)

## What Should the Images Show?

Your project images should be:
- Screenshots of your project running
- UI/interface photos
- Demo images showing the project in action
- Screenshots from your application or website

## Image Specifications

- **Recommended size**: 1200x800px or larger
- **Aspect ratio**: 16:9 (landscape) works best
- **File size**: Try to keep under 500KB for faster loading

## Adding More Projects

If you have more than 3 projects:
1. Add the image file here (e.g., `project4.jpg`)
2. Update the `projects` array in `components/Projects.tsx` to include the new project

## Example

```
public/
  projects/
    project1.jpg  ← Screenshot of your AI model interface
    project2.jpg  ← Screenshot of your CV application
    project3.jpg  ← Screenshot of your ML dashboard
```
